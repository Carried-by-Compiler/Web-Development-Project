Guys please make sure you've **watched** the GitHub tutorial. GitHub is very confusing to use. (I'm still currently not fluent with this yet </3)

P.S - I'm taking the usage of GitHub very seriously as it will be very very very helpful with our project as you will soon come to discover. Eventually we won't need the facebook chat to discuss code and any other ideas/features for the website.

P.S 2 - If you don't want to watch the videos here is a link to explain the mechanics of GitHub **in words** xD https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/?utm_source=onboarding-series&utm_medium=email&utm_content=read-the-guide-cta&utm_campaign=learn-github-flow-email

P.S 3 - Make sure you **__FORK__** this repo so that it can be added to your account. (Aaron had this problem already)
